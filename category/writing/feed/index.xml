<p>Yesterday I saw this somewhere written;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-primary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-643786ee15a6d2559bc0efeeef723d2e"> &#8220;Most people start working and get consistent not because of motivation, but because they are afraid to start over.&#8221;</p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">To think about it, I know that feeling. For me fear and exhaustion are the two reasons that keep me working even when I feel unmotivated.<br>" I don't wanna gain back the weight again, I don't wanna just be re-learning Em on guitar. I don't wanna be learning basic words and phrases again."</pre>



<p>I guess what I am trying to say is that working and staying consistent is really difficult but what&#8217;s even more exhausting, it&#8217;s starting over, again and again and again just because you felt like you can&#8217;t do it all those times before.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the matter of facing yourself and being aware of your abilities and also what you need and what you wanna be and learning how to balance all of those in a way that benefits you.</p>



<p>Are you exhausted of starting again, too?</p>



<p>Then let&#8217;s learn to stay consistent, together.</p>
