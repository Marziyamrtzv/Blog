<pre class="wp-block-verse">It was almost 3 years ago that I decided I wanted to learn German.<br>With the enthusiasm I had for languages, I've ordered my German Textbooks and started learning right away.<br>One month, two months... one year and then <strong>death</strong>.<br>I realized I no longer wanted to learn the language. Nothing could make me want to learn it, so I stopped but the expectation was still there so I studied new stuff on and off, without caring to review the old ones.<br>There were a lot of factors that contributed to me stop learning German such as; perfectionism, lack of plan and priority, lack of resource management, being on my own and most importantly: <strong>PROCRASTINATION</strong>.<br>If you go online, you'll find people who claim they achieved fluency in German (or any other language) in a short period of time.<br>Regardless of who's telling the truth and who lies, I really believe in the Parkinson law which says the course of action<br>stretches depending on the time you put into it.<br>So the more time you put into it, you're most likely to get it done faster and giving German which is a very complex<br>language grammar-wise, you are to put a lot of concentrated time into it in order to even be able to form a simple sentence.<br></pre>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">where am I and what I wanna do?</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-verse">In terms of level, I'm still very much a beginner in the vast field of the German language.<br>Since the last method (textbook) didn't really work for me, I modified my approach and got two other books. One is <strong>Assimil</strong> and the other is called <strong>Begegnungen</strong>.<br>Assimil is consisted of 100 short lessons. All lessons are in form of short dialogs presented in both German and English and you are to learn German through English.<br>These lessons are fun, they also have native audio files and can be done in less than an hour.<br>I'm in my second phase lesson 52 now. <br>It is said that after completing all 100 lesson both passive and active phases, you'll be somewhere around B2.<br>I am planning to use Assimil as my main resource and supplement it with Begegnungen which is a more structured textbook but the difference is that Begegnungen is designed for both classroom and self-studying that's why I find it way more convenient that any other textbooks. Also I'll be reading and listening more to German on a daily basis and cultivate using German in my life.<br>I am really excited about the results after finishing these books.</pre>



<p><em>All my results will be posted so stay tuned </em>:))</p>
